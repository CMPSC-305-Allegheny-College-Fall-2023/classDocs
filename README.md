## Course Description

Credits: 4
A study of the application and evaluation of database management systems. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students design, implement, and deploy database systems that store interdisciplinary data sets. In addition to learning how to develop and assess interfaces for databases, students study the efficiency and effectiveness of alternative data management systems. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: CMPSC 101. Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

## Distribution Requirements

The following definitions were taken from the Distribution Requirements: Learning Outcomes website, https://sites.allegheny.edu/registrar/academic-policies/ graduation-requirements/distribution-requirement/ distribution-requirements-learning-outcomes/.

* Quantitative Reasoning (QR). Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand, investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.

    + Learning Outcome: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their graphical or symbolic representations.

* Scientific Process a Knowledge (SP). Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

    + Learning Outcome: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

This course meets the course distribution requirements of QR (_Quantitative Reasoning_) and SP (_Scientific Process and Knowledge_) for its use of applying concepts of computer programming to the design and creation databases which are tested on public data from real-world applications. In addition, the class aims to introduce an component of ethical reasoning in the design, maintenance and application of database systems for potentially sensitive data.

## Course Objectives

The essence of the discipline of computer science is algorithms; this course will introduce students to the principles of data management using algorithms.

* To investigate some of the key technologies that scientists use to manage data.

* To explore and, gain skills and experience in relational databases through query languages, object-oriented data storage, low-level data storage, transactions and concurrency control, data warehousing and mining. 

* To facilitate, test and implement database applications and solutions through the creation of own coded projects.

* To introduce students to the theory and practice of data management while covering both the well-established and the cutting-edge areas of the discipline.

* To gain an understanding and appreciation for the contemporary roles of power and difference as they relate to the knowledge derived from a data set.

* To gain understanding of biases, discrimination and stereotypes that maybe present during collection, analysis, and reflection on the latent trends in real-world data sets.

* To gain practical experience in the design, implementation, and analysis of data management systems for research during laboratory sessions and a final project.

The course also invites students to assess the correctness of their implementations and conduct both analytical and empirical evaluations of the performance of data management techniques. Moreover, the course will ask students to implement small- and medium-scale data management systems and to install and use a wide variety of support tools. In addition to improving their teamwork skills, students will enhance their ability to write and speak about software in a clear and concise fashion. Ethical discussions are also introduced into the course to introduce students to the concepts of responsible computing.

## An Ethical Interest

Throughout the semester students will be challenged with serious or real-world types of questions concerning databases, data, usage and security. While no actual or definitive answers can be given regarding "correct" procedure in reaching solutions, students will reason with potential solutions and ideas to determine methods and techniques which should be motivated by ethical conduct.

The so-called “right” decision ought to be made by technologists who have studied both the data, and the consequences of decision in terms of humanitarian, environmental, ecological and other factors. This class cannot give students the correct decision, however it can help to enable  critical thinking skills which will provide students with some understanding of how to navigate to worthy decisions.

#### Gradebook Repository

We will be using GitHub to keep track of your grades in this class. Use the below link to establish your grade_book reposiory. I will be saving grades and feedback in a report file and sending it to this repository for each member of the class. Note: once you have accepted the homework (to which you will never have to submit anything), you can continue to use this link to access your `grade_book` repository. Cool, right?! 

* GradeBook repository: https://classroom.github.com/a/tk6oZ53N

#### Definitions of Grading Categories

 + __Class Participation__: All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms such as answering questions about the required reading assignments, completing in-class exercises, asking constructive questions of the other members of the class, giving presentations, leading a discussion session in class.

 + __Exam__: A midterm exam will cover all of the material in their associated module(s) up to the time of the exam. The finalized date for each of the exams will be announced at least one week in advance of the scheduled date. Unless prior arrangements are made with the course instructor, in absence of special arrangements, all students will be expected to take the exam at the scheduled date and complete it during the allotted time.

 + __Laboratory Assignments__: These assignments invite students to explore the concepts, tools, and techniques associated with the analysis of data. All of the laboratory assignments require the use of the provided tools to study, design, implement, and evaluate systems that solve data analytics problems. In addition 
 to demonstration of the technical skills through the utilized or developed software for data analysis, some of the laboratory assignments in this course may also expect students to read a related article and to lead a discussion or to give a short presentation related to the assigned article.

 + __Final Project__: This project will present you with the description of a problem and ask you to implement a full-featured solution using a wide variety of data analytics techniques. The final project in this class will require you to apply all of the knowledge and skills that you have accumulated during the course of the semester to solve a problem and, whenever possible, make your solution publicly available as a free and open-source tool. The project will invite you to draw upon both your problem solving skills and data analytics techniques.

### Assignment Submissions

Your instructor will be using GitHub Classroom to collect all assignments. It is expected that you are able to effectively use `git` to submit your work. If you require help, please see your peers, the Technology Leaders, or your instructor.

The three basic commands for submitting work are the following.

``` bash
git add -A
git commit -m "informative commit message" 
git push
```
**Note**: The commit message is supposed to be a meaning message about the pushed work. Please do not add commit states such as __My homework__, __Done__, __Oh yeah!__, or the like -- these message provide no information about the work that was sent to GitHub.

### Late Submissions

All assignments will have a stated due date. The electronic version of the class assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of the lab session on the due date. Submissions after the beginning of class are counted as being late.

__Assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. After that time, the lab will not be accepted.__

__Please note, lab solutions will be discussed after the one week late submission deadline. Therefore, any submission of the assignments following that deadline will not be possible.__

### Extensions

Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, __no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.__ If you are requesting extensions for a lab assignment, then you are to email me with your request and also provide a _valid_ reason for your extension. This request must come before the due date of the lab and __not__ on the due date.

The decision to provide you with an extension (or not) will be weighed in light of fairness to your peers who are still able to complete their labs, regardless of their own busy schedules.

### Communication

Various digital channels will be used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. It is strongly advised for the student to install the Discord app on their computer and smart-phone to be sure to receive all communications from the instructor, as well as, the other members of the class.

Additionally, the course website will be used to store the syllabus, course schedule and information about the `classDocs/` repository using the GitHub.  Your grades will be communicated to you by a Gradebook GitHub repository.

### Bring your own computer to class

The classrooms in the Department of Computer Science no longer provide machines for student use. You are to bring your own wifi-ready device to class to be able to follow along with course material. If the class is meeting online using Zoom, then please be sure that you machine is configured correctly to use these services to connect you to the class. As it is your responsibility to maintain your machine, please perform online research to determine how to configure your machine accordingly, or to install any necessary software to enable online meetings.

During the semester, you will be told which software to install on your machine to be prepared for class. Some of the prominent software that we may be using can be found at the following [resource](https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/resources/dataanalytics_resources/).

### Special Needs and Disability Services

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this legislation requires all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability Services at 332-2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

Some of the resources on campus are listed below.

### Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Course Catalogue.  The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College.  This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the final project).  All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.  Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

_I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole._

It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work.  While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss their programs, technical diagrams, proposals, paper reviews, presentations, and other items with their classmates or other individuals, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.

More information about the code may be found at the [Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/academic-honor-program/)
